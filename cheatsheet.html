                            referenced in the main text, but that can be moved to another page

                            numerals, letters or Romans numerals or even simple bullets. This

                            of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in
                            the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed

                            squared. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of
                            the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.
